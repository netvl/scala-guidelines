# Return statements

Scala allows using return statements in order to return from methods early. However, Scala is primarily an expression-based language, therefore using imperative constructs like returns usually hurts readability.

Moreover, `return` statements are always bound to the enclosing `def`, therefore, if `return` is used e.g. inside a closure, it results in a `try/catch` for a `NonLocalReturnControl` exception generated by the compiler.

The general rule is to avoid using `return`s, however, there are cases when they do increase the clarity of the code. Therefore, whether they are appropriate or not should be decided on a case-by-case basis during code review. Basically, `return` is allowed for the following cases:

```scala
// As a guard to simplify the control flow:
def doSomething(input: String): String = {
  if (!valid(input)) {
    return "something went wrong"
  }
  ...
}

// As an early return from loops
while (condition) {
  if (somethingHappened) {
    return
  }
}
```
