# General code style (TODO?)

As a general rule, constantly monitor warnings and other notices which your IDE shows you. IntelliJ IDEA in particular has clever analysis features which are very helpful to avoid many mistakes in the code style. If you use IDEA to make commits, enable "Before commit / Perform code analysis" option in its commit window - it will display all errors and warnings it sees in the code you're about to commit.
